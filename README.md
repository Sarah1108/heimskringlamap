# Mapping Heimskringla

#### Overview Information modelling

There are two common editions of Heimskringla. One by Finnur Jónson and a more recent one by Bjarni Aðalbjarnarson published in Íslenzk Fornrit.
The latter is used as the basis of our data collection. Not only due to it being one of the most used editions, but also because of the maps it contains. 

Our data collection includes a number of attributes: 
#### 1. oldnorseName
First it includes the Old Norse place name in the Nominative. It is recorded as a single entity in our data collection. 
#### 2. ID_Num
We used the register of the saga to extract all place names and assign an abstract ID. 
#### 3. Genus
For each Old Norse name we also collected the grammatical gender.
#### 4. modName
If known or existent the modern place name is added in the official language of the state the place is in today.
#### 5. Toponyms
Also included are four different types of toponyms that we classified the places into: choronyms for names of regions or countries, oikonyms for inhabited locations such as cities, villages or farms, oronyms for mountains, hills or mounds and hydronyms for all bodies of water such as rivers or streams.
Yes or no is noted on the question whether the place is part of the plot or just referenced.
#### 6. Longitude & Latitude
Geographical data is recorded in decimal coordinates in degrees and decimal degrees. In the case of countries that do not have a modern equivalent and therefore don’t have standardised geographical centerpoint data, we tried to choose an approximate centerpoint on the map.
#### 7. Path
We also include routes such as travel journeys or chases as they are an integral part of Heimskringla and it’s many settings. They are recorded by registering the corresponding place IDs.
#### 8. Function
Another feature is short categorisations of places, according to their function in the saga.
#### 9. Source(s) & Chapter
The references included are to the Íslenzk Fornrit edition, but also quoted with chapter. This is due to the fact that most of the text editions and translations are structured in the same chapters which makes the database usable for people without knowledge of Old Norse.
#### 10. Varia
The last section included is Varia. This is a place for added information that did not fit into the other sections.

#### The linked Excel sheet can be used as a template.
